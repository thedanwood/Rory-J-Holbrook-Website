                Top Ipswich Aggregate Supplier
            </h2>
            <p>
                As the top aggregate supplier in Ipswich and Suffolk, Rory J Holbrook aim to continue to develop our thriving relationships
                with our customers to provide aggregate delivery and collection services in Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, Bungay, Lowestoft, Newmarket, Southwold, Felixtow and beyond.
                <br/><br/>
                The aggregates provided by Rory J Holbrook are always created or recycled within the local area 
                and the UK. Recyled materials such as type 1 and concrete are processed and recycled in our innovative 
                recycling centre located at Lakenheath in Suffolk. This means that there is a reduction in commercial and construction 
                waste in the industry, which as an environmentally conscious company, we feel strongly about.

            <p>
                In an effort to minimise industrial and commercial waste, our recycling centre at <a href="/locations#location-lakenheath">Lakenheath Suffolk</a> processes and recovers material that would otherwise become redundant
                waste.
                <br /><br />
                The recycling of materials helps to reduce the environmental impact of our operations while also reducing the dependency and demand for primary rock and aggregates. Due to the geographical structure of Ipswich and the rest of Suffolk, 
                primary aggregates such as sand and gravel are abundant and commonly available. However, recycled materials are in more demand than ever with industries such as house building being pressured by the goverment to meet
